# LOVELACE DATA EXTRACTOR

This project is part of **Project Lovelace**, aiming to develop a price tracker for the [Ludopedia](https://ludopedia.com.br/) website, where a user can specify which games they want to track via a [Notion](https://www.notion.so) database.

**Lovelace Data Extractor** is an Azure Function app for interacting with the Ludopedia website to get the user's subscribed games info from the URL submitted in the Notion database through the [Lovelace Data Sync](https://github.com/Project-Lovelace-HQ/lovelace-data-sync) service. It is built with Python.
